// cmd.cpp - Command framework
// All command implementations have been moved to separate files:
// - SystemCommands.cpp
// - RestoreCommands.cpp
// - SearchCommands.cpp
// - DiagnosticCommands.cpp
// - CarveCommands.cpp
// - PEAnalysisCommands.cpp

#include "cmd.h"

// This file now only serves as a compilation unit for the command framework.
// Individual command implementations are in their respective category files.
